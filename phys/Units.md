SI (international system) is a common unit system that is used across the globe. The SI unit system has 7 fundamental (base) units. All other units are derived.

| Quantity    | SI units    | SI symbol    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Mass    | Kilogram    | Kg    |
| Length    | Meters    | m    |
| Time    | Seconds| s     |
| Current    | Ampere | A     |
| Amount of substance    | Mole | mol     |
| Absolute temp | Kelvin | K     |
| Luminous Intensity| Candella | Cal     |

Examples:
1) Express newtons in fundamental units
   - F= m x a 
   - units: N = kg x m/s^2 =
   - = kg x ms^-2 <- Exponent form needed for full marks


### Estimation and power of ten

Estimation is a technique that is used to quickly find numerical solutions, questions using estimation are called **fermi** questions 

Estimation is often used for questions that depend on the process.

Only powers of ten are used Eg. $10^2, 10^3$

| Prefix | Abbreviation | Value      |

| peta   | P            | $10^{15}$  |
| tera   | T            | $10^{12}$  |
| giga   | G            | $10^{9}$   |
| mega   | M            | $10^{6}$   |
| kilo   | k            | $10^{3}$   |
| hecto  | h            | $10^{2}$   |
| deca   | da           | $10^{1}$   |
| deci   | d            | $10^{-1}$  |
| centi  | c            | $10^{-2}$  |
| milli  | m            | $10^{-3}$  |
| micro  | $\mu$       | $10^{-6}$  |
