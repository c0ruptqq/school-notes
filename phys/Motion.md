### Galilean equation:

Scalar: 
$$\text{speed}=\frac {\text{distance}} {\text{time}}$$

Vector: 
$$\text{velocity}=\frac {\text{displacement}} {\text{time}}$$

$$V \text{[m/s]}=\frac {s \text{[m]}} {t \text{[s]}}$$

### Speed/Velocity change

$$\text{average speed}=\frac {\text{total distance}} {\text{time}}$$

$$v=\frac {\Delta s} {\Delta t} = \frac {s_2 - s_1} {t_2 - t_1}$$

Using differentiation:

$$\text{essence of change} = \frac {\text{infinitely small distance}} {\text{infinitely small time}}$$

So the differentiated equation for velocity would be:
$$v=\frac {ds} {dt}$$

### Distance and time graphs

$$y = mx+c$$
$$s = mt+c$$
Where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the y(s)-intercept

$\therefore$ when c = 0
$$s=mt$$
$$m = \frac s t$$

### Acceleration

In physics, when change is present it is final - initial values

$$a= \frac {v-u} {t}$$
Where $v$ is final velocity and $u$ is the initial velocity

In differential form:

$$a=\frac {dv} {df}$$

From the graph follows:
$$ a = \frac {\Delta v} {\Delta t} = \frac {dv} {dt}$$

Acceleration can also be obtained through double differentiation:

As:
$$v=\frac {ds} {dt}$$
And: 
$$a=\frac {dv} {dt}$$
$$\therefore a=\frac {d} {dt}(\frac {ds} {dt}) = \frac {d^2s} {df^2}$$
