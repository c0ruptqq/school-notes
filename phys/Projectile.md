- Objects move in two dimensions (Vertically and horizontally) 
- Combination of linear motion and free fall

As mentioned in [suvat](Suvat) there are a few formulas that can be useful, mainly the following will be used.

$$s = ut+ \frac 1 2 at^2$$

### Example of show a problem could be laid out

If we concider a ball on top of a one meter cliff height 1m which if given the constant velocity of $4ms^{-1}$ the follwing diagram could be drawn:

![problem](/img/phys/20.jpeg)

To find the distance traveled (S) and time taken to travel that distance we can seperate the ball's motion into horizontal and vertical:

| Horizontal      | Vertical        |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| s: ?            | s:1             |
| u: $4ms^{-}$    | u:0             |
| a:0             | a: $-9.81ms^2$  |
| t               | t               |


Where "t" is the same for both.

$\therefore$ Time can be calculated using the formula above and the values in the "Vertical" column
$$s = ut + \frac 1 2 at^2$$
$$1 = \frac 1 2(-9.81)t^2$$
$$t = \sqrt {\frac 1 {4.905}} = 0.45s$$

The sign in the above solutions changes to "+" under the root as time cannot be negative.

Using the above found time the displacement "s" can now be found for the horizontal motion component:

$$s = ut + \frac 1 2 at^2$$
$$s = (4)(0.45) + \frac 1 2 (0)(0.45)^2$$
$$s = 4*0.45 = 1.8m$$
