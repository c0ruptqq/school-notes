An electrical source (cell) has an internal resistance which oppose the flow of charge through it

A battery contains electrodes and a chemical solution which have their own resistance.

The internal resistance (r) of a source is defined as the loss of potential difference per unit of current in the source, as current passes through the source

Emf ($\xi$) is the pd across a voltage source. It is the wd per unit charge delivered by a source.

$\xi  = \frac W Q$
