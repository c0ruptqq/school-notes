S - Displacement

U - Initial velocity

V- Final velocity

A - Acceleration

T - Time

Useful formulae:

$$v^2 = u^2  +2as$$
$$v = u+at$$
$$s = ut+ \frac 1 2 at^2$$
$$s= \frac 1 2 (v+u)t$$
Galiean equation:
$$v =\frac s t$$


## D/T graphs

Integration is the opposite of differentiation

Integration is used to find the area under a graph

$$\int_0^t ydx = \int_0^t sdt$$

## V/T graphs

$$\int_0^t vdt = vt =s$$

### Motion Graphs 

If we concider a scenario where a ball is thrown up into the aiter and then caught on the way down the graphs for this scenario will be as follows:
