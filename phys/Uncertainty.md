## Limitations of Physical Measurements

Errors are unavoidable. They can be divided into two types:
- random
- Systematic

A random error is one that varies and is likely to be positive or negative (two-sided error)

A systematic error is one which is constant throughout a set of readings (usually one-sided)

To be precise - to be consistent
To be accurate - be close to the true vale


## Uncertainty

The uncertainty on repeated readings can be calculated using $\pm \frac {\text{range}} {2}$

A value should be presented as $\text{mean} \pm \text{absolute uncertainty}$ or $\text{mean} \pm \text{relative uncertainty}$

For analogue scales uncertainty is divided by 2. For digital it is not.

### Addition/subtraction

$(a+b)\pm(\Delta a + \Delta b)$

When adding / subtracting quantities: add the **absolute** uncertainties together

### Multiplication/division

$(a*b)\pm((\Delta a/a + \Delta b/b) * 100)$

When multiplying quantities, add the **percentage** uncertainties

### Raising to a power

$a^x \pm (x * (\Delta a/a)*100%)$

When raising to a power, multiply the exponent value by the percentage uncertainty
