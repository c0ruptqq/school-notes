Tells how many solutions there are 
$$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$$
Discriminant = $\Delta$
$$\Delta=b^2-4ac$$
$\Delta < 0 =>$ No real solutions

$\Delta = 0 =>$ One real solutions

$\Delta > 0 =>$ Two real solutions

## Binomial expansion

### Factorials 

To find a certain value in the pascal triangle a factorial can be used. A factorial can be represented by nCr or $\binom{n}{r}$. A factorial is calculated using the formula:

$$\frac {n!} {(n-r)!r!}$$

It is important to note that r starts from 0 and __not__ 1

When:
- r = 0 nCr = 1
- r = 1 nCr = n
