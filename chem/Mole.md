1 mole of any substance is $6.023 *10^{23}$ atoms.
Sometimes, the symbol $N_A$ is used to symbolise mole.

### Molar Mass (M)

Mass per moles of a substance ($g mol^-1$)

$n=\frac m M$

$mol=\frac {Mass} {Molar Mass}$

### Determining formulae

Molecular formula = formula showing number and types of atoms present in a molecule.

Empirical - simplest possible molecular formula, shows ratio of atoms in molecules.
