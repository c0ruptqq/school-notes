Ionisation is the measure of how easily an atom loses electrons to from positive ions. First ionisation energy denotes the energy needed for each atom is a gaseous state to lose one electron. 

Ionisation energy - The energy required to remove one electron from every atom in one [[Mole]] of a gaseous atoms of an element.

There are several factors that can affect ionisation energy:

- Atomic radius - The greater the distance from the nucleus to the outer shell the less nuclear nuclear attraction the electrons on that shell have.
- Nuclear charge - the more protons the nucleus has the greater the nuclear attraction between the nucleus and the outer shell.
- Electron shielding - Electrons repel each-other between shell, this is called electron shielding, as the outer shell is pushed further away the attraction to the nucleus decreases

A atom has as many ionisation energies as it has atoms on the outer shell. The _successive_ ionisation energies rise, as each electron is lost, and the attraction to the nucleus rises.


### Making predictions from successive ionisation energies

When there is a big jump in ionisation energy it usually indicates a change in shell as the shielding increases. Thus the group and period of the element can be identified.

### Trend in ionisation energies

The figure shows that there are:
- General increase in first ionisation energies across each period as the atomic radius decreases
- A sharp drop between the ionisation energy of the last element in one period and the first in the next

However, there are also drops within each period. These can be explained by the filling process of orbitals. The more _unpaired_ electrons there are in the outer-most orbital in an atom the higher the ionisation energy. However when there are two paired electrons the repulsion between them makes it easier to remove one electron.
