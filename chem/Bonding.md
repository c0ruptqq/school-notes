## Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonding - strong electrostatic attraction between a shared pair of electrons and nuclei of a bonded atom.

A covalent bond is localised, acting only on a shared pair of electron between two atoms, this forms a molecule.

Dot and cross diagrams are used to display covalent bonds.

### Single bonds

Paired electrons that are not shared (double blue balls) are called lone pairs.

### 'Excited' state

If an atom gains energy the electron can 'jump' and orbital and become unpaired, thus increasing the number of available electrons in the outer shell. 

Eg. Sulfur can have a valency(amount of outer shell electron) of 2,4 and 6, this happens as the paired electrons in 3s and 3p move into the 3d orbital:

### Multiple bonds

- Double covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between two shared pairs of electrons, most common are:

$$\ce{O=O}$$
$$\ce{C=O}$$

- Triple covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between three shared pairs of electrons, most common are:

$$\ce{N#N}$$
$$\ce{H-C#N}$$

### Dative Covalent Bonds

In a dative covalent bonds the shared pair of electrons are supplied by one atom, the shared pair used to be a __lone pair__. 

Eg. 

$$\ce{NH3 + H+ -> NH4+}$$

The '->' in the second diagram represents that both electrons were given by nitrogen.

An easy way to chek if the dot and cross diagram is correct is by adding up all the electrons in teh outer shells of all the ellements before and after.


### Average bond enthalpy (brief start)

Average bond enthalpy ($kJmol^{-1}$) is the measurement of covalent bond strength, the larger the average bond enthalpy, the stronger the bond. 


## Molecule Structure

Electron pairs have the same charge and thus repel. Electron shells seek to be as far away from each-other as possible. 

Eg. $\ce{CH4}$ has 4 $\ce{C-H}$ bonds, they are equal, and thus the shape is a tetrahedral with angles 109.5 between each bond. 

### Wedges 

To represent 3D shapes on paper wedges are used:

- __Top__ is used to represent a bond in the plane on the paper
- __Middle__ is used to represent a bond coming out of the plane on the paper
- __Bottom__ is used to represent a bond going in the plane on the paper

A lone pair is slightly closer to the center of an atom than a bonded pair, as it occupies more space. Thus it repels more strongly.

Thus:

bonded/bonded < bonded/lone < lone/lone

Generally, with each lone pair the angle decreases approximately by 2.5 degrees.

If a molecule as multiple bonds (eg. $\ce{=}$) each multiple bond is treated as a region. Thus in a $\ce{CO2}$ molecule the angles between bonds is 180 as the bonds are treated as $\ce{O=C=O}$. Another interesting molecule is $\ce{SF6}$

The angle is 90 as the shape of the molecule is _octohedral_ thus between _eachother_ the angle beween electrons is 90
