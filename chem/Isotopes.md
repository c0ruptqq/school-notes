The mass of an electron is $\frac 1 {1836}$

Isotopes are atoms of an element with a different number of neutrons.

Relative atomic mass - Ar is the weighted mean mass of an element compared with one-twelfth of the mass of one atom of carbon-12

Relative isotopic mass - mass of an atom of an isotope compared with one-twelfth of the mass of an atom of carbon-12

Why carbon 12:
- The isotope of carbon-12 is exactly 12 atomic mass units ($12u$)
- The standard mass for atomic mass is 1 $u$ ($\frac 1 {12}$ of carbon-12) 
- 1 $u$ is approximately the mass of a proton


Relative atomic mass:

$\frac {\text{abundance*atomic mass}} {100}$
