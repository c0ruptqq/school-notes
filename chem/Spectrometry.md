Mass spectrometry allows us to work out relative atomic mass of an element

Basic principle:
- A sample is placed in the mass spectrometer
- The sample is vaporised and then ionised to form positive Ions
- The ions are accelerated. Heavier ions move more slowly and are more difficult to deflect than lighter ions, so the ions of each isotopes are separated.
- The ions are detected on a mass spectrum as a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 
$${\frac m z} = {\frac {\text{relative mass of ion}} {\text{relative charge of ion}}}$$
