Electronegativity - ability of a nuclei to pull a pair of electrons towards itself within a covalent bond.

Eg

$$\ce{H^{\delta+}\bond{-}O^{\delta-}}$$
In which $\delta$ represents partial charge.

Electronegativity depends on two factors:
- Atomic radius - As the radius increases, electronegatitivity decreases
- Number of protons (unshielded electrons)[^1] - The higher the number of protons the higher the attraction

[^1]: Full electron shells shields the nucleus reducing electronegativity.

A dipole in a covalent bond does not change and is called a __permanent__ dipole

Thus:

$$\therefore N,O, F \text{ and } Cl \text{ have the highest electronegativity}$$

## Molecules and polarity


The formula for __electric dipole moment__ ($\mu$) is:
$$\mu = ql$$
Where:
- q - Charge of the dipole
- l - Displacement vector between dipoles 

The unit for an electric dipole moment is Cm (Coulomb Meter)

Molecules containing polar bonds are not always polar. Non-polar molecules have bonds that are usually arranged opposite eachother (Eg. $\ce{CO2}$). While polar molecules have bonds that are arranged in an asymmetric fashion. This can be explained as if the two dipoles are arranged opposite each other the vectors of their distances cancle out giving a 0 total dipole moment.

Eg. $H2O$ is polar as while it has two polar $O-H$ bonds they are not exactly oposite, thus the oxygen side has a $\delta-$ charge and the hydrogen has a $\delta+$ charge.
