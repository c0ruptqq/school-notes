Orbitals - Shells are made up of orbitals, an orbital holds two electrons with opposite spins. There are four types of orbitals (s-,p-,d-,f-), each orbital is a different shape.

Shell number = n

s-orbitals:
- shape of a sphere 
- each shell contains one s-orbitals
- the greater the _n_, the greater the radius of the s-orbital

p-orbitals:
- shape of a dumbbell 
- each shell from n=2 contains three p-orbitals ($\ce{P_{x}}, \ce{P_{y}},\ce{P_z}$ )

d- and f-orbitals:
- Shells from n=3 contain five d-orbitals
- Shells from n=4 contain seven f-orbitals

For easier classification each shell is split into sub-shells

Eg. 

n=1, 1s

n=2, 2s+2p

n=3, 3s+3p+3d

Within each shell each different sub-shell has different energy level, they are in the order: s,p,d,f. The sub-shells are filled according to their sub-shell energy levels. Within an orbital electrons have opposite spins (either up of down). Within a sub-shell orbitals have the same energy level, so one electron occupies each orbital before pairing withing orbitals start.
