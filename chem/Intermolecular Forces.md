### London Forces

London forces are weak intermolecular forces which exist between all molecules (polar/non-polar). Also known as an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction.

As electrons move around in a molecule their distribution becomes uneven, forming a changing __instantaneous__ dipole, which in turn, __induces__ a dipole on the neighbouring molecule. This repeats, causing molecules to attract. As such, induced dipoles are temporary. 

In a molecule, the larger the amount of electrons:
- The larger the instantaneous and induced dipoles
- The greater the induced dipole-dipole interactions
- The stronger the attractive forces between molecules

London forces are used to describe induced dipole-dipole interactions __only__

Van der Waals' forces are used to describe both permanent __and__ induced dipole-dipole interactions

### Simple Molecular Substances 

A simple molecular substance is made up of simple molecules such as $\ce{H2O}$ or $\ce{N2}$ which form a simple molecular lattice. The molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces, the atoms within molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds. 

#### Melting and boiling points
Simple molecular have low melting and boiling temperatures as the weak intermolecular require little energy to break. When the simple molecular lattice is broken, only intermolecular forces break not the strong covalent bonds.

#### Solubility 

##### Non-polar

Simple molecular compounds tend to be soluble in non-polar solvents. This is because when added to a non-polar solvent intermolecular forces form between its molecules and the solvent. Those interactions weaken the intermolecular forces in the simple molecular lattice, thus dissolving the compound. 

##### Polar

Solubility depends on the strength of the dipole. Polar covalent substance may dissolve in polar solvent as the polar molecules attract to the polar solvent molecules. The process is similar to dissolving an ionic compound. These rules extend to liquids and gases as well. In some compounds such as $\ce{C2H5OH}$ contain both polar $O-H$ and non-polar $C-C$ bonds and can thus dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents.

#### Electrical conductivity

There are no mobile charged particles in a simple molecular lattice and thus they are non-conductors of electricity. 

### Hydrogen Bonding 


A hydrogen bond is a special type of permanent dipole-dipole interaction. It can be found between molecules containing an electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons (O, H, F) or a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom.

A hydrogen bonds acts between a lone pair of electrons on an electronegative atom in one molecules and a hydrogen atom in a different molecule (Fig. 1). An hydrogen bond is denoted by a dashed line.

##### Hydrogen Bonds in Water

Due to having two lone pair on the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds, forming an open tetrahedral lattice (Fig. 2)
in which a linear $\ce{H\bond{...}O\bond{-}H}$ arrangement holds the water molecules apart

Water also has a relatively high melting and boiling points than the ones it would have had with normal London forces. Without hydrogen bonds water would have a boiling point of about -75C.

#### Hydrogen Bonds in DNA

In DNA A and T bases pair forming two hydrogen bonds and C and G pair forming three hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3)

They only bond in that configuration due to the shapes of the bases. Both A and G are purine bases with two-ringed structures. While T and C are both pyrimidine bases with single-ringed structures. (Fig. 4)
